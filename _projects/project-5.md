As part of my summer internship in Microsoft Innovation Labs, PES University, India we made an IoT system capable of the following:
- Road flooding information gathered using water sensors attached to street lamps and crowdsourced informationabout potholes using NGOâ€˜s.
- App provides an alternate route to the user if the road on the route is flooded. And a color coded route dependingon pothole density
