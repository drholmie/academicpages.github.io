Currently working with the developers of [Linkerd](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2) on building the architecture of said deployment and setting the environment for various tests, using kubernetes, docker, pulumi and Travis CI.

So far begun work on cluster formation on GCP and integration using pulumi scripts, after approval will work on running linkerd on the cloud cluster, and finish integration of test scripts.
