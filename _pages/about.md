I am currently an undergraduate at PES university, pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently focussed on Android development, security, distributed computing and their architecture.

I currently volunteer at Microsoft Innovation Labs, PES. I have also worked on an mentored project [Forget-me-Not](https://github.com/Dcoder99/Forget-me-not). Previously worked on a traffic redirection app during road flooding. 

Most recent projects include a distributed Machine Learning API(coming soon), a [distributed key-value store](https://github.com/drholmie/PseudoDist) from scratch using python and zookeeper, while dabbling in my hobbies as well. 
Thanks for visiting.
