I am currently an undergraduate at PES university, pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I have recently been focussed on Qauntum Computing, Application Development, Distributed computing and their architecture.

I am also an active member at Microsoft Innovation Labs, PES. I have also worked on and mentored two projects, named [Apathetic ML](https://github.com/DarkAEther/Apathetic-ML) in 2019 and [Forget-me-Not](https://github.com/drholmie/Forget-Me-Not) in 2018. I have also previously worked on a traffic redirection app during road flooding. I am an active contributor to [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra), and one of the core members for the first student driven Quantum Computing club in my state (Bangalore, India). 

Most recent projects include a novel algorithm for byzantine fault tracing, a distributed Machine Learning API, an app that alerts workers if they are going to fall asleep [Headsup](https://app.peer.us/papers/public/5ce595de3d15cf981d9cc74093f7a277), a [distributed key-value store](https://github.com/drholmie/PseudoDist) from scratch using python and zookeeper, while dabbling in my hobbies and hackathons as well.

Thanks for visiting.
